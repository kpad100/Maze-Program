# Maze-Program
Input a text file maze (in a specified format) and can play through the maze in a 3D, first person perspective by using the arrow keys on the keyboard to move.
Included a 2D perspective of the maze as a “mini-map” and to keep track of where the player is in the maze.
Created a separate wall object with fields for distance (int), left wall and end wall (booleans) which returned a specific polygon based on the distance and if it was a left wall or end wall.
List of walls updates as the player moves; player can only see 3 spaces ahead.
Music plays/loops in the background throughout the game.
